                <p>Moisturising your skin is an important in any skin care routine, really, yet it often goes misconceptualised. Many people
					think that they don't need to moisturise because their skin will just produce oil again. Well, this is false! While your
					skin DOES produce oily naturally after some time, lack of moisture in the skin will cause your body to overproduce oil in
					order to make up for it, causing the complete opposite of what we are going for! So in this article, we'll show you how
					to properly moisturise your skin.

				<p>So now you've found out your skin type, and the next thing is to find the right moisturiser. For oily skin types,
					usually a gel-type or water cream moisturiser is ideal as they are very lightweight and absorb quickly into the skin.	
					We recommend the First Aid Beauty Coconut Water Cream. It's incredible at absorbing quickly into the skin and can 
					handle the tough summer humidity so that you don't sweat it out during summer or hot days.
				</p>

				<p>A good tip for oily skin is to moisturise with a slightly heavier cream at night. It doesn't have to be drastic, but this
					ensures that we lock in the moisture at night, meaning our skin doesn't have to produce as much oil during the day to 
					compensate for moisture loss. Over time, you will notice that your skin becomes less oily throughout the day.
				</p>

				<p>Last up, we'll explain how to properly apply moisturiser. A lot of people may tell you to apply in certain directions, don't
					do this or else you will ruin your skin, and so on. These are completely false statements, so you don't need to worry about
					being very particular with applying. But a few things we recommend are rubbing a little bit between your hands and gently
					working it into the skin and apply enough pressure for the skin to absorb the product. Don't be too harsh and abrasive, and
					take your time! Remember, it's self care, after all! Another thing is not to forget the neck area to prevent aging as much
					as possible. Lastly, pat the moisturise after applying to further improve the absorption into the skin!
