                <p>Finding the right skincare products for sensitive skin can be very difficult. It seems like almost every product you try always
                    stings no matter what! So let's run down some of the best products that work for many people with sensitive skin.                    
                </p>   
				
				<div class="content-image">

                <p>First up we have the cleansers. If your skin is more on the dry sensitive side, we recommend the Krave Beauty Matcha Hemp Cleanser. It
					contains a lot of really helpful ingredients to soothe and heal your skin such as green tea, which reduces redness. This cleanser will
					not overly strip your skin and damage your skin barrier further.
				</p>

				<p>If your skin is more oily/combination type sensitive, we recommend the Simple Micellar Gel Wash which does a really good job of cleansing 
					for pretty much all skin types, while still providing that little bit extra deep cleansing for oilier skin without irritation or feeling stripped.					
				</p>

				<div class="content-image">

				</div>

				<p>For serums, we recommend the Krave Beauty Great Barrier Relief. It contains tamanu oil which is great for reducing redness and irritation 
					and also niacinamide for brightening any dark spots you may have. Ingredients such as safflower and rosehip are also included to reduce overall 
					sensitivity. Another serum we recommend for more oilier type skin is the iUnik Tea Tree Relief Serum. Tea tree when used in low concentrations 
					does an excellent job at reducing sensitivity in the skin. It also contains other beneficial ingredients for reducing irritation.
				</p>

				<p>Next up, we have some moisturisers. If your skin is more on the dry side, we recommend the Youth To The People Adaptogen Moisture Cream.
					Though it is more on the pricier side, it's extremely hydrating yet feels lightweight so it doesn't create a heavy and greasy feeling on the skin.
					It also contains adaptogens which reduce redness and sensitivity. 
				</p>

				<p>If you have oilier skin, we recommend the iUnik Centella Calming Gel Cream. It's also very lightweight and contains a high concentration of 
					Centella Asiatica extract which is a good antioxidant for environmental damage.					
				</p>

				</div>

				<p>Lastly, we have one sunscreen recommendation and that's the Purito Centella Unscented SPF 50, which will guaranteed work for your skin without
					irritating it or cause redness. And there you have it, our best products for sensitive skin!
