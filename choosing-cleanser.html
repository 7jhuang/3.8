                <p>Choosing the right cleanser that won't damage your skin barrier or dry out your cheeks can be difficult. The thing is,
                    combination skin doesn't require any special ingredients in your cleanser. In fact, it's better to pick a cleanser for
                    dry or sensitive skin so that you won't be overly stripping the drier areas of your face. A gel based cleanser can be
                    helpful for cleansing the oilier parts of your face and using a cleanser milk for the drier areas.
                </p> 
                    
                <p>If you tend to use a lot of cosmetics, it's a good idea to consider other products that you may be putting on your face, 
                    as this could mean your skin is getting all these extra ingredients put into it such as serums, toners, plant oils and 
                    so on which is causing a combination of oiliness and dryness. Some parts may be receiving an abundance of one product 
                    while others parts are receiving very little.

                <p>Finally, let's quickly run down a few cleansers that we recommend. We recommend the Neutrogena Liquid Cleanser. It's
                    perfect for sensitive skin as it is a very gentle and fragrance-free cleanser that won't irritate your skin. This is gentle 
                    enough for dry skin as well, so you don't need to worry about your skin feeling tight or stripped after cleansing.                 
                </p>
                
                <div class="content-image-left">
                    <img src="images/combo/hl_hydratingcleanser.jpg">
                </div>

                <p>Last up we have the Hada Labo Gentle Hydrating Cleanser. Although it is a foaming type cleanser which are typically known 
                    for drying out skin, this one is gentle enough on any skin types so you don't need to worry about drying out your skin. 
                    Additionally, it contains Hyaluronic Acid which will help moisturise your skin while you cleanse, so that your skin will
                     lock in additional moisture. We still advise using a moisturiser after cleansing though! And there you have it, some tips 
                     for choosing a good cleanser with a few recommendations!                
                </p>
