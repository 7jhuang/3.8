                <p>Many people get the term "dehydrated skin" confused with dry skin. Dehydrated skin is not a skin type like oily or dry skin.
                    It is actually a skin concern which can affect any skin type. Today we will teach you the difference between dehydrated 
                    and dry skin.
				</p>

                <p>So what's the difference?
                    <br><br>Dry skin refers to the lack of moisture in our skin in order to hold all of the hydration in. As you may know, our
                    skin naturally produces sebum that sits on the top layer of our skin to make sure the water in our skin doesn't dry out.
                    When we have dry skin, our skin isn't doing a proper job of producing that sebum. For dehydrated skin, it refers to not
                    having enough of that water in our skin. We need a good balance of sebum (in this case, moisture) and water (in this case,
                    hydration).
                </p>

                <p>How do you know you have dehydrated skin? And how can you treat it?
                    <br><br>Unfortunately, it can be quite complicated and differs for people. But for some, their skin can be producing as much
                    oils as ever and yet still feel very flat and dull. For dry skin types, some might experience their usually dry skin with
                    flaking, but even with moisturiser on, it's still not plump due to lack of hydration. So let's take care of this problem by
                    taking advantage of our night routine where we can try different products and not have to worry about sunscreen or looking
                    crazy to others.      
                </p>

                <div class="content-image">
                    <img src="images/dry/sf_triplelipid.jpeg">
                </div>

                <p>A good idea is to try a heavier moisturiser at night. This ensures that we are tackling the dry skin problem by ensuring our 
                    skin is retaining the moisture required. We recommend the SkinFix Barrier + Lipid-Peptide Cream. Lipids ensure our skin 
                    barrier is protected. But as we age, we lose more of those lipids and our skin barrier is put at risk. This cream will 
                    help to restore those lipids and as a bonus, works well during the daytime for dry skin types!         
                </p>

                <div class="content-image-left">
                    <img src="images/dry/vichy_mineralserum.jpeg">
                </div>

                <p>And lastly, we recommend using a serum to help restore the hydration that dehydrated skin needs. We recommend the Vichy Mineral
                    89 Serum which is rich in minerals but also contains a form of hyaluronic acid. Hyaluronic acid is a great ingredient for
                    hydration because it pulls in water from the air into your skin. However, if you live in a very dry climate, this may not
                    be an ideal ingredient for you as it will pull the water from out of your skin instead!                     
                </p>

                <div class="content-image">
                    <img src="images/dry/boj_serum.jpg">
                </div>

                <p>The second serum we recommend is the Beauty of Joseon Calming Serum which contains glycerin and panthenol, two more great 
                    ingredients for hydrating the skin. This serum is great because it's very lightweight, meaning you can barely even feel it
                    on your skin! Lastly, don't forget to stay consistent and you will guaranteed see fantastic results!
