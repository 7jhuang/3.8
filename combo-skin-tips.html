                <p>Shiny forehead and nose but dry cheeks? Well, you've likely got combination type skin. So what type of cleanser are you supposed
                    to use? One for oily skin or one for dry skin? Today we'll be giving a run down on some simple tips to help manage your
                    combination type skin.
                </p>

                <p>Combination type skin is difficult because some products may only work for the T-zone area and react on other parts of your face,
                    potentially causing additional dryness and irritation which is NOT pleasant! The first step is to ensure that you are cleansing
                    properly. You might be tempted to get a foaming cleanser to remove all the excess oils, but this will cause dryness on other areas
                    of your face. We recommend to use a gel based non foaming cleanser which will still clean your face without drying certain areas.                  
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>Next, you need to ensure that you are moisturising properly. The key is to find a moisturiser that contains ingredients to repair the
                    skin's barrier function and preserve moisture, but is lighter on the emollients which tends to create that greasy texture. Some
                    examples of emollients include shea butter, lanolin and petrolatum (Vaseline).                  
                </p>

                <p>The next tip we have for you is to never skip your sunscreen! However, allow yourself to have options. Maybe on some days, your skin
                    feels a little drier than usual and you want to use a more moisturising sunscreen. Or maybe on more humid days you want to go with
                    a lighter SPF with a slight tint. Just make sure you use what works for you and listen to what your skin needs!                    
                </p>

                <p>Another tip is to be guided by the driest parts of your skin when it comes to actives. So what does this mean? When you use retinoids,
                    they can be very strong on your skin and can cause damage. So start off with a little bit and see how your skin reacts. If the driest
                    parts of your skin can handle the retinoids, you can start increasing the dosage little by little. Over time, your skin will get used
                    to it, and even the dry parts of your skin won't be as sensitive.                 
                </p>

                    <img src="images/combo/nyx_blottingpaper.jpg">
                </div>

                <p>The last tip we have for you is to use powder-free makeup as this can aggravate acne prone skin. We recommend using light products, and
                    it also helps with keeping everything fresh and our skin looking alive and healthy. However, if you have a really oily T-zone, we 
                    highly recommend using blotting paper. Although any works, one that you can try is the NYX Blotting Paper. And there you have it, some
                    tips for managing combination skin!
