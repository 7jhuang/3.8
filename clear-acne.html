                <p>Acne is a struggle that almost everyone has faced at some point in their lives, and some are still struggling
                    to this day. The difficult thing is that there is no "one size fits all" product. But today, we'll be giving 
                    you a run down of some of the most promising products out there that you should give a try to combat against your acne!
				</p>
                
                <p>A key product you need in any skin routine is a good cleanser. Cleansers are tricky as they can strip our moisture
                    barriers, causing excess sebum production and make your skin more prone to breakouts. But finding the perfect cleanser,
					a gentle yet effective one will guarantee to cleanse your skin of all dirt and impurities without damaging it.</p>

				<p>An effective cleanser for oily skin is the La-Roche Posay Toleriane Purifying Wash. It's gentle but is effective in
					dissolving all the oils and excess sebum without drying your skin out.
				</p>

				<div class="content-image-left">

				<p>On the other hand, we recommend the 
					Simple Micellar Gel Wash which works with all skin types. It has a simple ingredient list but is excellent at
					cleansing the face without being overly stripping.
                </p>

				<p><br><br>Salicylic acid facial washes are also another great way to cleanse and exfoliate your face. Salicylic acid is an 
					amazing ingredient that pushes all the dirt out from deep within your pores. It's effective at clearing oiliness, blackheads,
					and whiteheads as well. Salicylic acid facial washes that we recommend are CeraVe Renewing SA Cleanser for oily skin,
					The Inkey List Salicylic Acid Cleanser, and the Neutrogena Acne Wash Cream Cleanser for dry skin.
				</p>

				<p>Though cleansers are an important step for a good skincare routine, moisturising is also a key step to protecting your
					skin barrier and keeping it hydrated. Niacinamide is an effective ingredient at getting rid	of sensitivity and 
					brightening dark spots. We recommend The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% Serum, The Inkey List Niacinamide Serum and Naturium
					Niacinamide 12% Serum.
				</p>

				</div>

				<p>Now one of the products that has taken the world by storm is the Paula's Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant. It's one of the most
					effective exfoliants that does an excellence job at removing all the dirt and oils from your pores, reducing hyperpigmentation,
					and just making your skin look overall brand new.

				<p>Last up we have products for spot treatment. Though spot treatments may not work for everyone, this spot treatment that has received positive
					feedback consistently is the Clinique Acne Clearing Solutions Gel. You only need to use the smallest amount and it will last you
					a long time! If you tend to get quite a lot of whiteheads, we recommend the CosRX Hydrocolloid Patches which create a protective layer
					preventing bacteria from entering your skin. It draws the oils from your skin and will guaranteed reduce the size of your spots overnight!
