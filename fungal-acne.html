                <p>So you might be wondering, what are those tiny bumps resembling pimples on my forehead that never seem to go away?!
                Those "pimples" are commonly known as fungal acne (pityrosporum folliculitis), although ironically it is not an actual type of acne.
                So products targeted towards acne will not have the same effect on fungal acne.<br><br>Fungal acne is a type of
                yeast (disgusting, I know!) caused by an overproduction of oil and moisture on the face. The yeast loves
                this type of environment and will continue to grow and produce all those little bumps across your skin.
                </p>

                </div>
                
                <p>Fungal acne typically occurs in people with oilier skin or who live in humid areas. It is also common
                    in athletes who tend to sweat a lot.<br><br>Now how can we treat it?<br><br>One key ingredient to combating
                    fungal acne is to use niacinamide. It has a lot of benefits for the skin such as controlling sebum production
                    which can help reduce the oiliness on your skin, preventing the yeast from growing. This not only targets the surface
                    problem, but also the root problem which will prevent future issues.<br><br>Another key ingredient is salicylic acid,
                    an exfoliating ingredient that goes deep into the pores to push out all the dirt and dead skin cells.
                    It's also an antifungal ingredient which means it'll prevent that nasty yeast from growing.<br><br>And finally,
                    a household item that we can use to treat fungal acne is shampoo! Anti-dandruff shampoo contains ketoconazole which
                    removes all the excess oil formed around the base of our hair shaft. Though shampoo is typically for our hair,
                    studies have shown that it is extremely effect in clearing fungal acne too. Just lather it on your damp face and use
                    it like a cleanser. And there you have it, the solution to treating fungal acne!
