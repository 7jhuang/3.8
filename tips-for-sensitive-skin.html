                <p>Sensitive skin can be very painful and hard to deal with! So let's run down some tips on what you can do to help ease it a little more.                    
                </p>

                <p>First, we recommend to work on repairing your skin barrier. When it's exposed lots of negative things, this can cause our skin 
                    barrier to become compromised and will result in dryness, irritation, redness and sensitivity. To fix this, we recommend using 
                    ingredients that are great for moisturising and hydrating (and of course, gentle too).
                </p>

                <p>Another tip is to keep your routine simple! Sometimes when we add lots of products into our routine and our skin suddenly reacts, 
                    it's very likely due to an ingredient in one of your products, but it will be tricky to tell which. It also results in risk of
                    your skin barrier being further disrupted. So by simplifying your routine, should you ever react to any of the products, it will 
                    be easier to tell by which, and will allow your skin to heal faster.               
                </p>

                <p>We also recommend to avoid fragrances, as they can further irritate the skin. Although they smell nice, they really don't do anything
                    helpful for your skin!
                </p>

                <p>Lastly, we recommend avoiding the sun as much as possible! It sounds silly, but the sun can cause extreme damage to the skin, especially
                    when it isn't protected properly by proper sunscreen. It can also cause extra irritation which is the opposite of what we are going for!
                    So try and avoid tanning and sunbathing while your skin is doing its best to heal itself. And there you have it, some tips for helping
                    with sensitive skin!                
                </p>
