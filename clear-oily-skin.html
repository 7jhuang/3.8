                <p>Oily skin can be a pain! There are many other factors that come into play when dealing with oily skin such as hormones, the
					environment we live in, and so on. So how can we possibly balance all these factors while maintaining a shine-free nose and 
					forehead?
				</p>
                
                <p>There are a few things we have control over in order to reduce the amount of oil our skin produces. The first thing is to
					NOT overcleanse! While cleansing your skin is great as it gets rid of all the excess dirt and sebum, overcleansing will cause 
					your body will react to this and begin producing even more sebum, the oil layer that protects and hydrates our skin and cause
					an even shinier effect which is not what we are after!
				</p>

				<p>The next thing is to use a good moisturiser at night. Now, it may seem a little contradictory, but here's the thing: at night,
					our skin goes through a process called transepidermal water loss, where water exits our skin, causing drying, sensitivity, aging,
					and so on. So by using a good moisturiser at night, you're locking in that moisture at night and our bodies don't need to produce
					as much oil in the day to make up for moisture loss. Makes sense, right?
				</p>

				<p>Now that we've explained some tips you can try, let's get on with the products! The first product we recommend is The Ordinary
					10% Niacinamide Serum. Niacinamide is an excellent ingredient at controlling oiliness which will consistently give you results.
					As a bonus, it's great for reducing blackheads and clearing dark spots too.
				</p>

				</div>

				<p>So earlier we mentioned that you should have a good moisturiser. But which one should you use? Well, we recommend the First 
					Aid Beauty Coconut Water Cream. It's incredible at absorbing quickly into the skin and can handle the tough summer humidity.  
                </p>

				<div class="content-image">

				</div>

				<p>Or if you're looking for a moisturiser that provides some treatment for acne or blackheads, we recommend the Some By Mi
					AHA/BHA/PHA Miracle Cream. It's a very lightweight consistency but you still get a bit of exfoliation. It contains some incredible
					ingredients such as centella asiatica extract known to calm inflammation and stimulate new cell growth.
				</p>

				</div>

				<p>Last up, we have some good sunscreens for oily skin. Sunscreen is one of the most important steps in any skincare routine because it
					protects our skin from the sun's harsh UV rays which can speed up aging and damage our skin. The first one we recommend is the Dear
					Klairs Soft UV Airy Essence with an SPF of 50! SPF 50 is the highest protection available, ensuring almost full protection against
					the sun. This product is a lightweight gel consistency that absorbs into the skin extremely quickly, leaving no oily feeling.
					It's not like traditional sunscreen that leaves the sticky feeling and white cast at all, so any skin tones can use this product.
				</p>
				
				<div class="content-image">
					<img src="images/oily/purito_sunblock.jpg">
				</div>

				<p>Another one we recommend is the Purito Comfy Water Sun Block SPF 50. It's also very lightweight and absorbs insanely quickly into the
					skin, again leaving no tacky feeling on the skin. Though there is a very minimal whitecast, the lightweightness of the product makes 
					up for it. And there you have it! Some of the best products for oily skin!
