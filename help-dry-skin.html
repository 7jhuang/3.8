                <p>When it comes to having dry skin, we need to be extra cautious about how we cleanse it, as many factors can cause damage to
                    the skin barrier such as using harsh soaps, or even just being exposed to water for too long, which is quite ironic. Water
                    making skin DRY? Well in fact, this opens up the skin barrier and leads to water loss and dryness. So how do we know what we
                    can put on our faces then without stripping it of its moisture?
				</p>

                    <img src="images/dry/albolene_cleanser.jpeg">
                </div>

                <p>Using a non-soap based cleanser is the best approach to dry skin. An oil based cleanser is good for breaking down sunscreen,
                    dirt, and sweat, followed by a gentle cleanser. We recommend the Albolene Moisturising Cleanser which contains mineral
                    oils that will dissolve all that gunk on your face.                    
                </p>

                <p>Another great alternative is Neutrogena Body Oil. It's fragrance free and has emulsifiers which means it will rinse off easily
                    without leaving an oily residue. It is a sesame seed oil which is helpful for dry skin. Although you can leave it on your skin,
                    it's a great way to cleanse off excess dirts from your skin anyway.                  
                </p>

                </div>

                <p>A good non-soap based cleanser we recommend is the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gentle Cleansing Lotion for Sensitive Skin. It contains 
                    a balanced pH level to not throw off the level of your skin barrier. Harsh soaps tend to be have a higher alkaline level but this
                    one is ideal for dry skin.
                </p>

                <div class="content-image">
                    <img src="images/dry/cv_moisturiser.jpg">
                </div>

                <p>If you have dry skin, you'd know that moisturising is absolutely crucial. We recommend the CeraVe Moisturising Cream which can
                    be applied to not just the face, but also the body, which is a bonus! However, some people have reported that using this cream
                    stung for them, so we have an alternative for you if your skin is a little on the sensitive side.                 
                </p>

                <p>Vanicream Moisturising Skin Cream is a very thick cream that is fragrance free. It has a minimal ingredient list so it's extremely
                    unlikely that it will irritate your skin.                    
                </p>

                <div class="content-image-left">
                    <img src="images/dry/cv_sunscreen.jpeg">
                </div>
                
                <p>Lastly to keep it short, we will be recommending some sunscreens. As you may know, sunscreen is important in any skin care routine,
                    really, but not all works for everyone. We recommend the CeraVe Hydrating Sunscreen SPF 30. While some sunscreens can leave a white
                    cast, this one has a slight tint to blur out any blemishes you may have while moisturising your skin and protecting it from the sun's
                    harsh UV rays. And there you have it, some of the best products for dry skin!
